    <h2>About</h2>
    <h3>TFTS Postgraduate Film Club</h3>
    <p>Film Club will run every Wednesday from 6:30pm in the Parry-Williams Cinema. Each week, PG students and staff will select films and present them for informal discussion. If you can make it, it would be great to get as much involvement as possible. The club is predominantly for Postgraduate Students, but Undergraduate students are also very welcome.</p>
